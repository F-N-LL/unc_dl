# Unc_dl

Unc_dl is a YouTube to MP3/MP4 Downloader CLI script-app. As every good Unc, we love saving time and money and having an offline storage of content to watch or listen.

A bash script that downloads YouTube videos and converts them to either MP3 or MP4 format, saving them directly to your iCloud Drive's Unc_dl folder. The script features an interactive interface with progress tracking and customizable quality settings.

Make easier to download and store your videos or mp3 files and listen to them in you iPhone later, even offline. Ideal for podcasting.
